Short list of types that a receiver should handle:

type           expected method
-------------------------------
<null>         pushNull
boolean        pushBool
int32          pushInt (overloaded on 32-bit int)
int64          pushInt (overloaded on 64-bit int)
double         pushDouble
const char*    pushString

for lack of any better ideas have these functions return true on
success and false on error

should add more later.
