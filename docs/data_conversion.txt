Short list of types that a receiver should handle:

type           		expected method
-------------------------------
<null>         		pushNull
boolean        		pushBool
int64          		pushInt (overloaded on 64-bit int)
double         		pushDouble
const std::string&	pushString
???					pushUndefined

int32          		pushInt (overloaded on 32-bit int)

for lack of any better ideas have these functions return true on
success and false on error

should add more later.
